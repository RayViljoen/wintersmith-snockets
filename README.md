then add `./node_modules/wintersmith-snockets/` to `config.json` like:

    {
      "locals": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8080",
        "name": "The Wintersmith's blog",

### Test

Test is written using [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/). Install it globally, then run

    $ mocha

or
  
    $ npm test

***PS: wintersmith-snockets will handle all coffee-script compilation, so wintersmith-coffee is no longer required, although it will not cause problems.***
